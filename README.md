## Project 02- PotterWorld

### Pair programming exercise with fellow student developer, Cuong Tran.

# Intro 


# Getting Started
Clone or download the repo
- npm init
- npm run serve to start

# Brief
Consume a public API â€“ this could be anything but it must make sense for your project.

Have several components - At least one classical and one functional.
Include wireframes - that you designed before building the app.
The app should include a router - with several "pages".
Have a visually impressive design
Be deployed online and accessible to the public.

## Timeframe
2 days

# Technologies used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6)
- React
- Unnofficial HP API 
- Webpack
- Bulma
- Babel
- Insomnia
- Git
- GitHub

# Wireframing

Our app has 4 main pages which is Welcome, Characters, Spells and House Sorting. 

# Project Structure
In order to request the correct data, it is important to read through the documentation. We spent sometime on testing the urls. 

## Fetching the API

## Rendering

# Wins
Retrieving different types of data from the API and exploring it using different combinatio  of urls. The excercise helped me better understand how APIs work.
Explored the use of Bulma, and CSS animation combination.

I learned a lot about pair programming through this exercise. We had a lot of fun working together but it really highlighted to me how a different pace of learning in combination with working towards a strict 2-day deadline, can impact the workflow. It inspired me to want to explore React further after the exercise!

# Challenges  
We had initially only spent just over a week on React before getting assigned a 2-day project. Out dreams were a tad on the ambitious side, and soon realised we couldn't get the design polished up in time.

While working on the project, I had to refer to the React documentation a great deal, read, learn, and code at the same time. It was challenging  to provide a completely finished app, but I'm happy Cuong and I could continue working on it after the deadline, in our spare time.
